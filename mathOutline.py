#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

var = 4 + 4 
x = 4+4
print(x)

y = "name" + "your"
print (y) 

x = 4 - 3
print (x) 

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 4 - 3 
x = 4 * 4 
print(x)


#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = "michael" * 4
print (x) 
x = 4/4 
print (x) 

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 4/4 
print (x)

var = 20 
varTwo = 2 

x = var * varTwo
print (x)

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 5 % 4 
print (x)


#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.

x = 4 // 4 
print (x)

x = 5/4 
print (x) 

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 4 // 4 
printe (x) 

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 2 ** 2 
print (x) 

x = 4 ** 2 
print (x) 


#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.



#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 4 // 4 
print (x) 

print ("This is" + string)


#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
y = 2 ** 2 
print (y)


#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error

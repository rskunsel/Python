This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
'''
4 == 4 
#True 

2==4 
#False 

2< 3
#true

3<2
#False 

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
'''
v = (4==5) 
print (v) 


#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

x = "michael" == "Tenzin"
print (x) 

x = "michael"=="Michael 
print (x) 

x = "michael" == "michael" 
print (x) 

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
 
 x = "michael" == "michael" 
print (x) 


#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

y = 4 > = 4
#True 
print (y) 

r = 3 > = 4 
print (r) 
#flase

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
v = (4 == 5) 
print (v) 

g = "rinzin" == "rinzin "
print (g) 
#True 

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

x = "michael" == "Michael"
# False because one M is lower case
